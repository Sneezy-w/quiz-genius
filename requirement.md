# AI Quiz App Prototype Development Document

*Last updated: October 2023*

---

## 1. Introduction

The AI Quiz App allows users to generate quizzes dynamically by leveraging the Google Firebase ecosystem for authentication, database, and storage, while using Gemini AI to create quizzes based on user-uploaded project knowledge. Users log in, create projects, upload knowledge (text/documents), and then configure quiz parameters such as difficulty and number of questions. Once the quiz is generated, users can take the quiz and receive results.

---

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. Frontend  
- **Framework:** (e.g.) React, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Pages:** Login/Signup, Dashboard, Project Creation, Knowledge Upload, Quiz Configuration, Quiz Generation, Quiz Taking, Results Page

### 2.2. Backend & Database  
- **Authentication & Database:** Google Firebase (using Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore/Realtime Database, and Firebase Storage)
- **AI Integration:** Gemini AI API (for quiz generation)
- **Serverless Functions:** Firebase Cloud Functions (to securely call Gemini AI and handle backend logic)

### 2.3. Data Flow Overview

1. **User Authentication:**  
   Uses Firebase Authentication for secure sign in/up.

2. **Project Creation & Knowledge Upload:**  
   Projects are stored in Firestore with metadata. Uploaded knowledge files are held in Firebase Storage for later retrieval by the AI engine.

3. **Quiz Generation:**  
   Once the user configures the quiz parameters, a Firebase Cloud Function triggers a call to Gemini AI with the project knowledge and parameters (difficulty, question count). The AI returns a generated quiz (questions and options), which is stored in Firestore.

4. **Quiz Taking & Results:**  
   The generated quiz is presented to the user. Upon submission, results are calculated and stored for future reference.

## 6. Integration Details

### 6.1. Google Firebase
- **Authentication:**  
  Use Firebase Authentication SDK for login and signup.
- **Firestore:**  
  Store project metadata, quiz configurations, and results.
- **Storage:**  
  Save uploaded project knowledge files.
- **Cloud Functions:**  
  Write functions that:
  - Trigger on quiz generation requests.
  - Call the Gemini AI API securely.
  - Write back the generated quiz data to Firestore.

### 6.2. Gemini AI Integration
- **API Call:**  
  Develop a secure Cloud Function that:
  \[
  \text{POST } \{ \text{Gemini API URL} \} \text{ with payload: \{ knowledge: [...], difficulty: ..., questions: ... \}}
  \]
- **Handling Response:**  
  Parse the response to extract questions and options. Validate the AI’s response format.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Handle API failures gracefully by relaying meaningful messages to the user.

---

## 7. Security & Error Handling

- **User Authentication:**  
  Ensure that all Firebase rules restrict access; only authenticated users may access or modify their projects.
- **Data Validation:**  
  Validate all user inputs (e.g., quiz configurations, file uploads) on both client and server sides.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Display user-friendly error messages for issues such as network errors, invalid file formats, and AI API failures.
- **Secure Storage:**  
  Use Firebase Security Rules to ensure that uploaded files and Firestore documents are only accessible by their owners.

---

## 8. Prototype Development Roadmap

1. **MVP Scope:**
   - User Registration/Login.
   - Dashboard with Create Project functionality.
   - File/Text upload for project knowledge.
   - Quiz configuration and generation integration with a dummy Gemini AI response (if the actual API isn’t available).
   - Basic quiz taking and results page.
  
2. **Development Phases:**
   - **Phase 1:**  
     Setup Firebase integration (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) and basic UI pages (Landing, Login/Signup, Dashboard).
   - **Phase 2:**  
     Develop project creation, knowledge upload, and Firebase Cloud Functions for handling uploads.
   - **Phase 3:**  
     Implement Quiz Configuration Page and stub out a Cloud Function that simulates a Gemini AI call.
   - **Phase 4:**  
     Integrate actual Gemini AI call once available, complete the quiz taking and results pages.
   - **Phase 5:**  
     Testing, security hardening, and UI/UX refinements.

---

## 9. Additional Considerations

- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:**  
  Ensure the UI is accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigability) and responsive for mobile devices.
  
- **Analytics & Logging:**  
  Integrate analytics (Firebase Analytics) to track user behavior and quiz performance.
  
- **Scalability:**  
  Plan for future features such as statistics dashboards, social sharing, and team collaboration features.

- **Documentation & Comments:**  
  Maintain clear documentation in the code and API endpoints for future development.
